# Rails Joins Playground (Console-Only)

This is a lightweight Ruby on Rails 7.2.1 application designed for developers to practice SQL joins using the Rails console. It uses two main resources: `Customer` and `Order`. The app models a basic business relationship where customers place orders.

The focus is on exploring different types of joins (`INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, `CROSS JOIN`, etc.) through real queries in the Rails console, using both ActiveRecord and raw SQL.

> ðŸš« **Note:** This app does **not** include any views or frontend. It's purely a backend data model intended for SQL join experimentation.
